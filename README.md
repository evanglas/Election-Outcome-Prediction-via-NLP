## Project Title
Predicting 2020 County-Level Election Outcomes via Covid-related Excerpts from Local News

## Abstract
In recent years, United States news outlets have received increasing criticism for political bias. This report seeks to test the hypothesis that political polarization affected reporting of the COVID-19 pandemic in local news outlets. A dataset of samples of excerpts of textual media was collected and labeled according to each locality’s voting results in the 2020 presidential election. Several models were trained and tested on this dataset, including a Naïve Bayes model, a Logistic Regression, a lightweight neural network, and an LSTM. The Naïve Bayes model was then used to generate an artificial dataset over which each model was evaluated once more. The models demonstrate reasonable performance on out-of-sample data, suggesting a possible link between US counties’ political lean and representation of the pandemic in local media.
